Pyspark code


%sql 

SELECT * FROM EMP

%sql 

with cte1 as (
select * , lead(receiver,1,sender) over(order by (select 1) ) as receiver1 ,
lead(sender,1,receiver) over(order by (select 1) ) as sender1,
lead(sms_no,1,0) over(order by (select 1) ) as sms_no1
from subscriber
)

select sms_date , sender as p1 , receiver as p2 , sms_no1 + sms_no as total_message from cte1 where sender1 = receiver and sender = receiver1
select * from subscriber


This is correct


Insert query was missing


CREATE TABLE subscriber (
sms_date date ,
sender varchar(20) ,
receiver varchar(20) ,
sms_no int
);
-- insert some values
INSERT INTO subscriber VALUES ('2020-4-1', 'Avinash', 'Vibhor',10);
INSERT INTO subscriber VALUES ('2020-4-1', 'Vibhor', 'Avinash',20);
INSERT INTO subscriber VALUES ('2020-4-1', 'Avinash', 'Pawan',30);
INSERT INTO subscriber VALUES ('2020-4-1', 'Pawan', 'Avinash',20);
INSERT INTO subscriber VALUES ('2020-4-1', 'Vibhor', 'Pawan',5);
INSERT INTO subscriber VALUES ('2020-4-1', 'Pawan', 'Vibhor',8);
INSERT INTO subscriber VALUES ('2020-4-1', 'Vibhor', 'Deepak',50);
